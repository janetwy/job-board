# Recipe Search App

## Description
As someone who loves to cook, I'm always looking to cook something new. I've used many websites and apps to find recipes of foods from my childhood and to explore new recipes, but it has become increasingly difficult to organize all the recipes I've collected over the years. I want to use this opportunity to organize my collection and aggregate recipes from various sources to make them more easily searchable and accessible.

## Main Objective:
* Allow user to search for recipes
* Inspire user to cook new recipes

### MVP Features:
* Search for recipes by name
* Filter recipes
	* Cuisine
	* Difficulty 
	* Ingredients
	* Special Diet
* Create user account
* Favorites list/Bookmarks
* Generate random recipe

### Stretch Features:
* User profile
* Macros planning
* Weekly meal planning
* Filter by ingredient list
* Instagram search integration
* Gamify recipe completion

## Technologies
This is simply a side project I'm creating for fun so keeping the costs low or free is a priority. I brainstormed project ideas by surveying free APIs already available on the internet. I stumbled across [this repository of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) as one of the first few search results. Naturally, I chose a [food related API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-docs-recipe-api).
